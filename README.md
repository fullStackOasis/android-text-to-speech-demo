# Android Text-to-Speech Demo (TTS)

This is a very simple demo with a single Activity.

User needs to provide a TTS source if none is found.

After that, user can type text into an input field, and click a button to produce the text-to-speech audio output.

There's a [YouTube video that shows the working app](https://youtu.be/r9EpYZ7c6Zg). It's just a recording using the Android Emulator (for convenience), but it works the same on a real device.
